# User Journey

After creating an account a farmer lands on a clean home dashboard with quick actions to begin weighing or record births, recent reports, and simple stats that point them to what matters now. They register animals and keep an up‑to‑date inventory, then organize them into herds with a lightweight create box they can collapse when not needed. From the Groups page they can add or remove animals, quickly open a herd’s members (which always reflects the latest composition), and archive or restore herds as the season changes. The app’s consistent tab layout and calm, readable design keep navigation effortless across Animals, Groups, Weights, and Births.

When a pen needs to be split, they choose the source herd, name the new herd, and select which animals move—after confirming, they’re returned to Groups with both herds immediately updated. When consolidating, they can select multiple herds and merge them into a single target in one pass (the target keeps its name and sources are archived), keeping records tidy without manual cleanup. For performance tracking, they jump into weighing, browse or record measurements, and generate reports that compute key metrics like ADG; AI summaries spotlight top and low performers, surface anomalies, and suggest next steps. In the Births view, they track mothers, litters, and offspring and generate reports with the same helpful AI guidance—making better health, feeding, and marketing decisions with fewer clicks and more confidence.
